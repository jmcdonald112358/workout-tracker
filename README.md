### Accreditations
- Front end code supplied
- Primary reference to complete this assignment was week 17 activity 26, as well as activities 11 and 17
- General Google searching and StackOverflow for assistance working through specific issues
- Assistance from classmates to get a couple routes working correctly

### Additional notes
- I have struggled to get the database communicating with the deployed version of this app. It works great on localhost, but myself and a couple classmates could not make sense of why the two aren't communicating for the deployed link. Everything appears to be configured correctly as far as we could tell, so, not sure what I'm missing.
